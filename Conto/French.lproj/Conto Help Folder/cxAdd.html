<p>Each Conto's document corresponds to one year of transactions, from January to December. I have chosen this implementation because it reflects the way I manage my bank account.</p>

<p>To add a record, choose the appropriate month from the pop-up button, fill in the text fields and click the <b>Add</b> button or hit the <b>Return</b> key. The date must be written according to the format specified in the <b>Preferences</b>. If you leave the <b>Date</b> text field blank, the current date is provided for you.</p>

<p>You have basically two ways of deciding whether the amount you enter is an income or an expense: either you select the appropriate radio button or you enter a negative value. A negative income is considered as an expense, and viceversa. If you leave the amount field blank, then it is considered as zero. If you want to insert both an income and an expense in the same row, see how to <a href="cxEdit.html">edit records</a>. If the <b>Tick Off</b> checkbox is selected, a checkmark appears in the entry.</p>
