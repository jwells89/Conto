<p>Instead of typing the same description text over and over, you can add a predefined description. Moreover, you can optionally specify an operation for the Income field and an operation for the Expense field to be associated with a given description. For instance, you can specify that each income associated with a certain description must be increased by 10 euros (or whatever currency you use) and that each expense must be decreased by 20%.</p>
<p>In the <b>Preferences</b> window, select the <b>Descriptions</b> tab. Add a description in the <b>Description:</b> text field. If you want to link an operation to that description, select the desired item in a pop-up menu and insert a value in the corresponding text field. The text field is formatted according to your Preferences settings. Push the <b>Add</b> button. The new description is added to your list of predefined descriptions.</p>
<p>You can rearrange the order in which predefined descriptions appear by dragging them in the desired position.</p> 
<p>That's all. The descriptions you add become available in the pull-down menu of the main window. If the option <b>Autocomplete descriptions</b> is checked, you can type the first few characters of a description to have it automatically completed for you.</p>
<p>If there is an operation associated with a description, when you add a record having that description the corresponding operation is automatically applied. Please note that <i>no operation is applied</i> when you subsequently edit the record by double-clicking on it.
