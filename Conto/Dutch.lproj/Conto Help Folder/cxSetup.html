<p>No setup is necessary, but you may want to edit the preferences to comply with your requirements. By default, Conto uses the euro currency symbol after the number, the comma as a decimal separator, the period as a thousand separator and  two decimal digits. You may quickly and flexibly modify all these settings in the <b>Preferences</b> window.
</p>
<p>In the <b>Preferences</b> you can also change the date format, choose to show/hide a grid in the tables, to use a smaller or bigger font, to use <a href="cxEncryption.html">encryption</a> to protect your documents and to add or remove <a href="cxPredefinedDescriptions.html">predefined descriptions</a>. 
<p>Ah, do you see the image view on the upper-right corner of the main window of a document? You can drag an image on it. This serves no purpose, but having an "icon" for the document (I dragged my bank's logo).</p>
